Analysis of UNICEF’s flagship publication - Intelligence Analytics Challenge 5.0

Each year, UNICEF’s flagship publication, The State of the World's Children, closely examines a key issue affecting children. The statistics includes the numbers for the following categories:
• Basic Indicators
• Nutrition
• Health
• HIV/AIDS
• Education
• Demographic Indicators
• Economic Indicators
• Women
• Child Protection
• The Rate of Progress
• Adolescents
• Disparities by Residence
• Disparities by household wealth
• Early Childhood Development
• Under-Five Mortality Rankings

Analysis of these data were done in Tableau and various insights were drawn from the graphical representations. Recommendations were given based on the statistical insights to improve the 'under-5 mortality rate' of children.  

The IAC_Project_specification.pdf details the data description and the challenges to be encountered. The IAC_Code geeks.pdf is the project report which provides the steps taken to find the insights, results drawn from insights, and the recommendations provided based on the insights to improve the children's quality of life. The IAC_5.0_Code_geeks.twb is the tableau file containing the dashboards created. IAC-5_Dataset_Original is the dataset used for this project.
